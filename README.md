Project Title: "Automated Smart Car Parking System Using Arduino and Sensor-Based Control"

Project Description:
This project presents a smart and automated car parking system using Arduino IDE, designed to efficiently manage vehicle parking spaces while reducing human intervention. The system utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect vehicle presence, servo motors to control barrier gates, and an LCD display for real-time parking status updates.

Key Features:
Automatic Vehicle Detection: Ultrasonic sensors detect vehicles entering and exiting the parking lot.
Barrier Control System: Servo motors open and close gates based on parking availability.
Real-Time Display: LCD screens show the number of available and occupied slots.
LED Indicators: Green and red LEDs signal parking availability.
Energy Efficient: Low power consumption with optimized hardware usage.

Technologies Used:
Arduino Uno (or similar microcontroller)
Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)
Servo Motors
16x2 LCD Display with I2C Module
LED Indicators

Applications:
Smart Parking Lots in shopping malls, offices, and residential complexes.
Traffic Management to reduce congestion in urban areas.
Automated Toll and Entry Systems for improved security.
This project enhances parking efficiency, minimizes human intervention, and contributes to smart city infrastructure development. ðŸš—ðŸ”§
